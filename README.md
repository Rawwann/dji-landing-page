üìù Overview

This project is a static landing page for the DJI Mavic 4 Pro drone product. The page was built using only HTML and CSS, focusing on applying fundamental web design concepts such as element structuring and styling, building layout using float, using position for overlapping and fixed elements, and applying simple effects using pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.

Goal: To practice building a complete web page from scratch using traditional layout techniques (Floats) and practically understanding the Box Model and Positioning.

‚ú® Page Features

Hero Section: Main product showcase with a prominent image, essential information, price, and interactive buttons (Add to Cart / Wishlist).

Fixed Navbar: Remains visible at the top of the page when scrolling.

Specifications Comparison Table: A table designed to display product specifications and compare them with other products.

Customer Reviews Section:

Ratings summary with a star rating breakdown chart.

The summary column remains fixed (position: sticky) while scrolling.

Displays individual customer reviews using a card design for each review.

Related Products Section: Displays additional products as cards using float with simple hover effects (scaling).

Multi-Column Footer: A footer containing links and information distributed across columns using float.

Layout using Float: The primary column structure (Layout) in most sections of the page was built using the float property, utilizing clear-fix to ensure proper layout.

Positioning Usage: position: relative, position: absolute, position: fixed, and position: sticky were used to place elements like Badges, fix the Navbar, and make the reviews summary box sticky.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
